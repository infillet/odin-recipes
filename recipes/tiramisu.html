        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a nice version of the popular Italian pick-me-up dessert. The toffee candy in this recipe adds a delightful crunchiness to the smooth creamy whipped cream quality of an already perfect dessert.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (10.75 ounce) package frozen prepared pound cake, thawed and cut into 9 slices</li>
            <li>¾ cup strong brewed coffee</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>½ cup chocolate syrup</li>
            <li>2 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>2 (1.4 ounce) bars chocolate covered English toffee, chopped</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Arrange cake slices on bottom of a rectangular 11x7 inch baking dish, cutting cake slices if necessary to fit the bottom of the dish. Drizzle coffee over cake.</li>
            <li>Beat cream cheese, sugar, and chocolate syrup, in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth. Add heavy cream; beat on medium speed until light and fluffy. Spread over cake. 
                Sprinkle with chocolate-covered toffee candy.
            </li>
            <li>Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, but no longer than 24 hours, to set dessert and blend flavors.</li>
        </ol>
