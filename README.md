# odin-recipes 

This is the odin-recipes project.

Prior to starting the TOP, I already had some experience working in HTML. Since then, I've learned some new resources. Among them is TOP and Git. This is a simple HTML project to showcase simple elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, images etc.
