# odin-recipes 

Hello Odin! This is the odin-recipes project.

Prior to starting the TOP, I already had some experience working in HTML. It was a lot of fun and since then, I've learned some new resources. Among them is TOP and Git. Regardless of my prior experience, I have no doubt this project will reinforce some of the skills introduced in the curriculum, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and images.
